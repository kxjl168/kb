# Pasting Content from Microsoft Excel

<p class="requirements">
    This feature was introduced in <strong>CKEditor 4.7</strong>. It is provided through the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/pastefromword">Paste from Word</a> plugin that is included in the Standard and Full presets available from the official CKEditor <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site. You can also <a href="#!/guide/dev_plugins">add it to your custom build</a> with <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">CKBuilder</a>.
</p>

The [Paste from Word](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/pastefromword) plugin allows you to also paste content from **Microsoft Excel** and maintain original content structure and formatting. As of CKEditor 4.7 some more advanced Excel features are not supported yet and will be added in future CKEditor releases.

When the plugin is enabled, it automatically detects Excel content and transforms its structure and formatting to clean HTML. It also adds the **Paste from Word** toolbar button (<img src="guides/dev_pastefromword/pastefromword-button.png" alt="Paste from Word toolbar button" style="vertical-align: bottom;">) which makes it possible to paste clipboard data this way only on demand.

## Supported Features

The following formatting will be reatained when pasting from Microsoft Excel:

* Text formatting
    * Text and background colors
    * Font name, style and size
    * Basic formatting (bold, italic, underline)
    * Font effects (strikethrough, superscript, subscript)
    * Heading levels
    * Text alignment
* Cell formatting (size, background, borders, special characters)
* Row and column size

## Sample
